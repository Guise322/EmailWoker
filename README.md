# EmailWorker
This project is a service worker that allows users to work with emails on the background.
This project is a service worker that allows users to: make requests to it by email; mark all the unread message from a email as read

## Motivation
I came up with this idea when I needed a pet project and some automation to work with emails. I also discovered there were no obvious way to work with
a big number of emails by means of the email services.

## Platform Version
.NET 6.0
